## Notes
    -All functionality should work. 
    -If for some reason something doesnt work, most likely after you tried to test an invalid file/data restart the process without the invalid file/data and it should work. (ofcourse ill lose mark for the error checking). Therefore, I would recommend testing all valid data first and then invalid data.
    -the routes and found and renamed using the route name so if there are multiples routes with the same name it may not work correctly.
    -The route must be selected from the drop down box above the rename for renaming
    -In order to add a route. If you want to add waypoint to it then insert latitude and longitude and add waypoint as many times as needed. Then add the route name and add the route. Remember to select the file your adding it to from the first drop down box (In GPX view Panel)
    -the scroll wheels for the execute query table appears after around 5 rows
